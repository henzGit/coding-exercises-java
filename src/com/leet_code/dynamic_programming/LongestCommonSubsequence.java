/**
 * Given two strings text1 and text2, return the length of their longest common subsequence.
 * If there is no common subsequence, return 0.
 *
 * A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some
 * characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.
 *
 * For example, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde".
 * A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.
